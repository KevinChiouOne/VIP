To create a code span, put your code span content between backtics.
`CODE SPAN CONTENT`

If you want your code span to contain backtics, surround the entire code span with double backtics and a space.
`` CODE SPAN CONTENT `CODE SPAN CONTENT BETWEEN MY BACKTICS` ``

In a sense, this works like single and double quotes inside of one another.
