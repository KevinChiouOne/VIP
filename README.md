## Shell Crash Course

# [Shell 101](https://github.com/inkVerb/vip/tree/master/101-shell)

# [Shell 201](https://github.com/inkVerb/vip/tree/master/201-shell)

# [Shell 301](https://github.com/inkVerb/vip/tree/master/301-shell)

## First

*This is italics, giving you instructions or explanation; they never end with a period*

*Here is monospace code style:* `cp /alldirs ./bookkeeping/`

*In monospace, every character is the same width, it is meant to indicate a coding language*

*This is because both terminals and text editors use monospace fonts, being easier to use*

*Only and always enter monospace into the terminal if it is:*
1. Normal size, not a header size
2. Begins the line, not later in the line like this `cd .trash`

*Note that you would normally enter this, below, into the terminal...*

`cd ~/`

*Below is a block of code, merely for your reference; do not enter it in the terminal*

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# This is a comment in the code

echo "I am actually a real command."

exit 0

# That is all there is to this block of code

```

That is the end of the instructions. You should feel like a better person.

# Oh, and have a cookie for finishing: ### #

## Installing Linux & Vrk
*Optional free tools: If you want your own Linux PC super media workstation...*
1. Install Ubuntu via [these fast instructions on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9NvmAitlwA&list=PLizgE6nGB1Kx8jIY1JE2v9rcL9G9s_UDj)
2. Install Vrk and Vubuntu via the commands at [verb.ink](http://verb.ink)
3. Type with correct fingers. Learn here: [write.pink/88](http://write.pink/88)

## About Linux
The Linux command line only requires a bootable Linux USB, such as [Ubuntu via unetbootin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYfEs0lQA8Y&index=4&list=PLizgE6nGB1Kx8jIY1JE2v9rcL9G9s_UDj). It's the best place to begin to understand computer codeâ€”basic commands, if-do statements, variables, arrays, functions, and more. Learn it simple in Linux first.
